This is the To Do List for the VS Code Essbase Language Extension

1. Streamline regex for strings, interpolated strings. It contains a lot of extra code that is unrelated to Essbase language and is a remnant of the original code samples.
2. Update Number regex. The numbers regex includes a check for hex values (i.e. 0x000000) which aren't used in Essbase. Another remnant of original code. 
3. Add in more programatic features available within VS Code, such as hover, completions, etc.
4. Add more snippets to the snippets collection.
